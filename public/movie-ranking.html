<h1> Luke's Movie Review!</h1>
<h2> My top THREE movies of ALL TIME...(so far)</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Cars (2006)</h3>
   <p>
       A fan favourite through my childhood years. A great soundtrack and some amazing
       story, and a nostalgia trip to say the least. What's not to love?
   </p>
<h3> Hot Fuzz (2007) </h3>
   <p>
       One that I learnt about later in life, but I love all the same. Filled with
       endless laughs and timeless references, It's one I can't help but quote on
       a daily basis.

<h3> Good Will Hunting (1997) </h3>
   <p>
       Again, one that I found as I got older, but nonetheless shot up the movie rankings
       immediately. A mixture of laughs, pure emotion and the legend that is Robin Williams,
       it just had to make the list. How do you like them apples?
